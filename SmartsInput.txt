Mental Health (NIMH) is to support small businesses to develop
technologies that can advance the mission of the Institute, including
in basic neuroscience research relevant to mental disorders,
translational and clinical research of mental disorders, clinical
diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders, and dissemination of
evidence-based mental health care.  This FOA will utilize the NIH
R43/R44 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grant - Phase I,
Phase II, and Fast-Track award mechanisms.

SYNOPSIS:  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) invites pilot and feasibility clinical and
behavioral studies related to the prevention or treatment of diabetes
and endocrine and genetic metabolic diseases. The Pilot and
Feasibility Clinical Research Grants Program is for exploratory,
short-term clinical studies, so that new ideas may be investigated
without stringent requirements for preliminary data. The short-term
studies should focus on research questions that are likely to have
high clinical impact. Studies can include testing a new prevention
strategy, a new intervention or a unique combination of therapies. A
high priority is the use of such studies to help stimulate the
translation of promising research developments from the laboratory
into clinical practice in the treatment or prevention of diabetes,
endocrine diseases and genetic metabolic diseases, including cystic
fibrosis.  This program will use the NIH Exploratory/Developmental
(R21) grant mechanism.  <S2S>
